# OyoState_flood_prediction
The risk of floods has naturally increased due to climate change variability, rapid urbanization, and rapidly expanding spatial development. This hazard to human lives and the global economy has become quite severe. The study focused on evaluating the risk of pluvial flooding using a fuzzy rule-based methodology and creating a susceptibility assessment application (SUSAP) that can identify and forecast flood susceptibility, as well as enhance the management of potential pluvial flooding risk through the application of machine learning techniques. It was centered on a dataset that was gathered from the Ibadan Metropolis in Oyo state, South West Nigeria, by the Copernicus Climate Data Store and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using the ArcGIS software. A total of 144,401 records and 8 conditioning variables out of 53 were gathered.
